                        Picture this: you're staring at delayed treaties while floodwaters are rising. You're buried in paperwork for the mandatory 4% cession to traditional reinsurers, a process that bleeds your margins. Manual placements take weeks, and when claims finally come through, they're often met with delays. This isn't just inefficient; it's a direct hit to your profitability and forces you to offer higher, uncompetitive premiums to your clients.

                        You need cheaper, faster, smarter backup — without begging regulators.
